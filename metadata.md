## Portfolio Presentation Tips

**Opening Line:**
"Erasmusly is a production-grade full-stack platform I built and deployed to solve a real problem faced by international students: finding housing and compatible roommates in unfamiliar cities."

**Technical Deep Dive:**
- Frontend: "I used React with Vite for fast development and optimized builds, TailwindCSS for modern UI, and Axios with interceptors for API communication."
- Backend: "The backend is an Express server with PostgreSQL, using native pg driver for performance. I implemented JWT authentication, protected routes, and Socket.io for real-time chat."
- Deployment: "I deployed the frontend to Vercel's global CDN and the backend to Render, configuring environment variables for dev/prod separation and CORS for secure cross-origin requests."

**Impact:**
"The platform is fully functional with 1000+ seeded records, real-time messaging, and a responsive UI that works across devices. It demonstrates my ability to build, secure, and deploy production-ready applications."
